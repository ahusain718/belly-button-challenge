Bacteria Cultures Dashboard
This project creates an interactive dashboard for visualizing bacterial culture data from samples, using D3.js and Plotly.js to display both a Bubble Chart and a Horizontal Bar Chart.

Project Features:
Metadata Panel: Displays demographic information about the selected sample.
Bubble Chart: Visualizes bacterial cultures per sample, using OTU IDs as x-axis and sample values as the y-axis. The size of the bubbles represents the sample value, and the color represents the OTU ID.
Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 OTUs found in a selected sample, with the number of bacteria (sample values) as the x-axis and OTU IDs as the y-axis.
Interactive Dropdown Menu: Allows users to select different samples and view their respective data and charts.
